# Coding standard

## Processing and Java

### Prefer newer features over older ones

As a general rule, when there are similar functions, use the newer function in principle. New features generally improve the shortcomings of older features.

## Java

- Respect the [Code Conventions for the Java™ Programming Language](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html). It's an old document, but it's still valid.
- Also respect the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Newer knowledge is reflected.

### Local variable declarations

- Prefer type inference(`var` type identifier) for local variable type declarations
