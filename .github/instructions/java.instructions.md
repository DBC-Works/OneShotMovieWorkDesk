# Instructions for Java files

## Avoid Java features that cannot be used in Processing

Some Java features are not available in Processing and should be avoided, for example:

- Switch expressions
- Sealed classes

## Prefer newer features over older ones

When there are similar functions, use the newer function in principle.
